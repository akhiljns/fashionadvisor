            <p><strong>Fashion</strong> is a popular style or practice, especially in clothing,footwear,accessories,makeup,hairstyle and body. Fashion is a distinctive and often constant trend in the style in which a person dresses. It is the prevailing
                styles in behaviour and the newest creations of textile designers.Because the more technical term <em>costume</em> is regularly linked to the term &quot;fashion&quot;, the use of the former has been relegated to special senses like fancy
                or masquerade, while &quot;fashion&quot; generally means clothing, including the study of it. Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are androgynous. </p>
            <!--<p>Fashion Contests have become very popular in the recent times and hence the need for a fashion judgement.In reality, it is a tough process of elimination with high criticism and one needs to feel confident with his/her decisions as well as
                with opinions. Judges must be impartial yet show decisive action when scoring the contestants. Drawing from their knowledge of the fashion industry can aid in the contestant process, especially when noting criticism or praise for an item
                created and pointing out in detail the opinion of the score. Most contestants enter to get their recognition but also to get the necessary critical assessment from leaders in their represented fields. </p>-->

            <p>Press releases, events, photo series, influencers and sponsorships are all powerful public relations tools with their own individual uses and strong points. Sponsorships are amongst the most costly investments in their public image a luxury
                brand can make. But if the outlet is selected correctly, the impact on public opinion can be powerful and long-lasting.For sponsors, fashion weeks are brand-building platforms.More sponsors means bigger budgets.  </p>
